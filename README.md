# 👋 Hey, I'm Matteo!

**Master's student in Industrial Automation Engineering with a passion for robotics and AI** 🤖✨

Currently at Sorbonne University for a double degree program. I work with robotics, computer vision, and deep learning to build systems that solve real problems.

I've been lucky to win a hackathon, place 2nd in a national competition, and attend some great summer schools along the way. Always excited to work on projects that make a difference! 🚀
