## 🚀 Personal Projects

- 📹 **Reolink Detect AI**  
  A Python-based smart home security system using Reolink cameras, OpenCV, and YOLOv8. It reduces false alerts by combining motion detection with object detection and sends annotated alerts only when people or cars are detected.  
  Includes support for multiple RTSP streams, real-time parallel processing, and dataset saving for model fine-tuning.  
  🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maedmatt/reolink-detect-ai)

- 🚵 **Downhill Event Detection (ML)**  
  Detected downhill biking events from time-series sensor data. Reached 80.6% accuracy using Weighted-KNN with synthetic oversampling for class balancing.  
  🛠 Tech: MATLAB, Signal Processing, Bootstrapping

- 🧍 **Action Recognition System**  
  Real-time action recognition using OpenMMLab and OpenCV. Achieved 89% accuracy on a custom dataset and optimized inference for macOS devices.  
  🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maedmatt/actionRecognition2025)

- 🧪 **Industrial Vision System**  
  Built a system for liquid level detection that reduced manual inspection by 70%. Adaptive thresholding handled varying lighting conditions.  
  🛠 Tech: MATLAB, Image Processing
