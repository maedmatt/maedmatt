# 👋 Hey, I'm Matteo!

**Master's student in Industrial Automation Engineering with a passion for humanoid robots** 🤖✨

Currently at Sorbonne University 🇫🇷 for a double degree program. I have experience with robotics, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and VLMs/VLAs.

Outside of regular classes, I've attended summer schools, won a hackathon, and placed 2nd in a national competition.
